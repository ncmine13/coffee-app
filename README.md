# coffee-app
This project was partner programmed with Ben Gimbel, a classmate. The idea behind this project came from many experiences as a barista where I was confronted with "What should I get?" from customers at the register. Because there can be a sense of mystery and exclusivity in the coffee business, many people, including me before I began working in the industry, have trouble sorting through the fancy-sounding drinks in a cafe's menu. This app helps the indecisive user make a selection and the unknowledgable user navigate through the confusing lingo.

The app is build with Node, Express, and a Mongo database.

Plans for the future:
-Add more drinks and logic paths to find drinks
-Link to Google Maps and allow users to find nearby shops
-Make entirely responsive
-Emphasize buttons before user has selected drinks, and only show user's "Picks" after they have logged drinks
